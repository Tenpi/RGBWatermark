## RGBWatermark

RGBWatermark provides strong watermarking protection against AI/machine learning art theft.

This is the standalone version that can be run locally, there is also an online version found here:
https://rgbwatermark.net 

With strong settings, it is impossible to remove. I hope it helps!
